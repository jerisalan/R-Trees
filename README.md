# R-Trees
This project is a simple Java based visualization for R-Trees which are a tree based data structure for spatial access methods and indexing. A common real-world usage for an R-tree might be to store spatial objects such as restaurant locations or the polygons that typical maps are made of: streets, buildings, outlines of lakes, coastlines, etc. and then find answers quickly to queries such as "Find all museums within 2 km of my current location", "retrieve all road segments within 2 km of my location". 

This project only aims to implement the algorithms mentioned in the paper below and does not have any results collected as part of the implementation.
